This repo is aimed to store the exercises from Ellen Korbes' Go course available at https://www.youtube.com/@AprendaGo, which is a translation and entirely based on Todd McLeod course from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/).

Throughout the course, after each chapter, there were exercises aimed to reinforce the knowledge. I've organized each chapter in separate folders and its exercises as well. Inside each exercise file, there's the challenge to solve.

As a summary, those were the chapters covered in the course:

* 1 - Variables, values and types;
* 2 - Programming fundamentals;
* 3 - Control flow;
* 4 - Data grouping;
* 5 - Structs;
* 6 - Functions;
* 7 - Pointers;
* 8 - Applications;
* 9 - Concurrency
* 10 - Channels;
* 11 - Error treatment;
* 12 - Documentation;
* 13 - Testing and benchmarks;
