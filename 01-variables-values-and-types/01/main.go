In practice: exercise #1
These are your first exercises, and your first steps.

By completing the exercises in this section, you will be a level 1 ninja.

It's your first step to becoming a developer ninja.

These exercises serve to reinforce your learning. You only learn to program by programming. Nobody learns to ride a bike by watching videos of people riding a bike. It is necessary to put your hand in the dough.

I'll start by explaining what the exercise is. Then I'll ask you to pause. This is the time to put your brains to work, find your solution, tec-tec-tec, and run it to see if it works. Then just hit play again, see my approach to the same question, and compare our solutions.

Let's go:

Using the short declaration operator, assign these values ​​to variables with identifiers "x", "y", and "z".

42
"James Bond"
true
Now demonstrate the values ​​in these variables, with:

A single print statement
multiple print statements

*/

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 42
	y := "James Bond"
	z := true
	fmt.Println(x, y, z)
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Println(y)
	fmt.Println(z)
}
