/*
In practice: exercise #5
In the chapters that follow, one of the things we'll look at is testing.
To test your ability to fend for yourself... challenge:
Using the following sources: https://godoc.org/testing & http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/12
Try to figure out for yourself how tests in Go work.
You can use automatic translator, you can run code on your machine, you can Google it. Anything goes.
The exercise is: create a simple test of a function or method or piece of code.
